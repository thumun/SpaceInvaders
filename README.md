# Physics Invaders (Space Invaders with Physics) 

# Gameplay Overview 
Physics Invaders is based on the game Space Invaders, developed by Atari in 1978. However, unlike the original game, this version has physics and is in 3D! 
It mirrors the classic game elements: there are rows of invaders trying to destroy the player's spacecraft, and the player must destroy them or be destroyed. 
The goal of the game is to defeat all the aliens and/or attain a high score by defeating the invaders and the mystery ship.
